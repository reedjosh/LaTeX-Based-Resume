\opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}

I was first introduced to HDLs and FPGAs in my Digital Design course at Oregon State that I would 
later become a teaching assistant for. From here, I applied this experience to a large VHDL project 
completed successfully during a six month internship at Garmin AT. I have been
chasing VLSI projects ever since.

Beyond this, I've always loved audio. I built my own bookshelf (tweeter, woofer, and crossover) 
speakers, installed far too much car audio equipment and built an electric guitar. To say 
Cirrus Logic would be my dream employer would be an understatement!

I believe my interests and experiences make me an ideal candidate for an entry-level 
engineering position within your organization, and particularly this FPGA Synthesis position.

I want to add, I am not only willing to relocate, but excited about the prospect. Please review my 
resume, and if you would like me to provide any further information please don't
hesitate to call anytime. My cell number is (971)275-5001, and I hope to speak with you soon.

\closing{Best Regards,}

\end{letter}
