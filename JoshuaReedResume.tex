               {Technical Marketing Engineer Intern}
               {July - September, 2016}
               {As a Technical Marketing Engineer Intern I participated in team meetings 
and gave occasional presentations. My primary focus was a regression testing program that 
converted arbitrary graphs in node neighbor format to usable input for Mentor's Calibre tools.
Before this project, corner case tests were tediously hand drawn and black box
random testing was infeasible. This program facilitates these tests and allows Mentor
to reproduce customer test cases without proprietary customer data. As a result, Mentor's 
tools are more robust and easier to develop.}

               {As a Digital Design Teaching Assistant I worked directly with instructor 
Matt Shuman to help guide the lab 
portion of the course. On occasion I developed and lead lectures,
managed lab grading, and built lab study material. One of
the larger projects I developed for the course was an FPGA voltmeter which included 
a SPI module written in System Verilog.}

              {Design Engineer Intern}
              {March - September, 2015}
{As a Design Engineer Intern at Garmin AT I interacted with a team of 
four and my team lead on a daily basis. Primarily I worked to redesign a 
portion of an aerial receiver's HDL that targeted an Altera FPGA. The main goal of
this redesign was to reduce logic utilization. I achieved a reduction of $60\%$ 
while also implementing VHDL 2008 constructs to develop cleaner, more extensible code. 
Other projects included parsing CSV Oscilloscope readings of USB communications, 
automating top down compilation order of VHDL projects using Python,
and developing a % 
circuit to multiplex LCD display data. During this internship I gained experience 
with a large VHDL project, circuit design and layout, power
supply design, Visual Basic, Python and Batch scripting, and electronics lab tool usage.}

%{As a Maintenance Supervisor at Riverstone Residential I managed a team 
%of three people toward the goal of maintaining 
%over 350 homes located within a 10 mile radius. My responsibilities included: ordering
%supplies, scheduling of both vendors and employees, maintenance repair requests and 
%resident communication. While in this position I developed skills in problem 
%solving, communication, time management and leadership.}

\projdescription{VLSI System Design}
                {I worked with instructor Roger Traylor to integrate FPGAs into OSU's 
VLSI System Design course. This included preparing and delivering two demonstrative 
lectures, building course assignments and exploring design options. During this process, I
designed a blinking led pll demo and a sine wave generator which utilized the 
FPGA's on chip rom.}

\projdescription{Senior Design High Field Pulse Magnet}
                {Our project met or exceeded initial requirements. I helped
achieve this goal by designing a voltmeter and voltage warning indicator. For the 
final prototype I successfully designed and utilized a PCB.}

\projdescription{Increased Power Amplifier Design}
                {I implemented a bridged amplifier design to improve upon a USB powered 
discrete transistor amplifier. To do this I added a unity gain stage to one half of the 
amplifier, inverting the phase of the original signal.}
