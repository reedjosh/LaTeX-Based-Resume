    Oregon State University \\
    Graduation: June 16, 2017 \\
    Current GPA: 3.47

\section{Experience}
\vspace{-2mm}

    \job {Internship Technical Marketing Engineer}
         {Mentor Graphics}
         {June--November, 2016}
         \begin{itemize}
           \item Reproduced a customer bug without relying upon customer's proprietary data, \\ and created a test case free from NDA constraints.
           \item Created a regression test generation program which converts arbitrary 
                 graphs in node neighbor format to usable input for Mentor's Calibre tools.
           \item Used the test generation program for black box random and corner case testing.
        \end{itemize}

    \job {Digital Design Class \& Lab Teaching Assistant}
         {Oregon State University}
         {Spring, 2016}
         \begin{itemize}
           \item Designed volt-meter final lab project framework. This was written in 
                 System Verilog targeting a Lattice FPGA which communicates with an 
                 external ADC via SPI.
           \item Designed and delivered lectures on topics such as Karnaugh maps, registers,
                 and System Verilog to class of more than 80 students.
         \end{itemize}

    \job {Internship Design Engineer}
         {Garmin AT}
         {March--September, 2015}
         \begin{itemize}
           \item Redesigned an aerial receiver's signal demodulation logic achieving a 
                 $60\%$ reduction of logic usage while implementing new VHDL 
                 standards to develop cleaner, more abstracted and extensible code.
           \item Created a program  which troubleshoots and decodes USB communications given 
                 voltage readings in CSV format.
           \item Created a script which generates a top down VHDL project compilation order 
                 given only the project source files.
           \item Built a circuit that multiplexes display signals and provides
                 a controlled current source for the device's backlight.
         \end{itemize}

    \job {Electrical Fundamentals Teaching Assistant}
         {Oregon State University}
         {Winter, 2015}
         \begin{itemize}
           \item Lectured for weekly recitations on topics such as nodal and mesh 
                 analysis and Thevenin and Norton equivalencies.
           \item Created and graded weekly quizzes and practice worksheets.
         \end{itemize}

    \job {Digital Design Lab Teaching Assistant}
         {Oregon State University}
         {Fall, 2014}
         \begin{itemize}
           \item Guided lab sessions twice per week focusing on topics such as logic
                 gates, Verilog, and block diagrams.
           \item Graded all lab projects for the term.
         \end{itemize}


\section{Projects}  
\vspace{-2mm}
    \project {C/C++}
         \begin{itemize}
           \item \href{https://github.com/reedjosh/small_shell/blob/master/smallsh.c}{\underline{Small Shell} }
                 a simplified unix shell capable of executing built in and independent \\ commands. 
           \item \href{https://github.com/reedjosh/arm_microcontroller_radio/blob/master/lab4/lab4.c}{\underline{ARM Microcontroller Based Alarm Clock}}
                an AT Mega 128 based alarm clock radio featuring, rotary encoder and button controls, seven segment displays, adaptive \\brightness, and more.
         \end{itemize} 

    \project {Senior Design High Field Pulse Magnet}
         \begin{itemize}
           \item Worked in a three person team to build a high field pulse magnet.
           \item Pulse magnet successfully generates field pulses in excess of 20 Tesla and 
                 crushes \\ quarters to the size of a dime using this massive magnetic field.
           \item Responsible for over-sized voltage display, PCB, and safety power indicator.
         \end{itemize} 
    

    \project {VLSI System Design}
         \begin{itemize}
           \item Worked with senior instructor Roger Traylor to integrate an Altera FPGA 
                 into OSU's VLSI System Design coursework.
           \item Created a PLL LED demo project and lectured on PLL implementation, of which 
                 the 
                 \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_A8ZVw8vDrfZHMtQ0pHdFRmeWM/view}{screen-capture}
