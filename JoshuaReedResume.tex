              {Technical Marketing Engineer Intern}
              {Summer, 2016 - Current}
              {As a Technical Marketing Engineer Intern I participated in team meetings 
and gave occasional presentations. My primary focus was a regression testing program that 
converted arbitrary graphs to geometric edge-separator pairs for use as input to Mentor's 
Multi-Patterning tools. Mostly written in Python, this project parsed graph files, generated SVRF and TVF
scripts and managed process control of external programs. Designed for use in a Linux
environment, I gained experience interacting with Linux development tools and 
the operating system itself.}

              {Design Engineer Intern}
              {Spring \& Summer, 2015}
{As a Design Engineer Intern at Garmin AT I interacted with a team of 
four and my team lead on a daily basis. Primarily I worked to redesign a 
portion of an aerial receiver's HDL that targeted an Altera FPGA. The main goal of
this redesign was to reduce logic utilization. I achieved a reduction of $60\%$ 
while also implementing VHDL 2008 constructs to develop cleaner, more extensible code. 
Other projects included parsing CSV Oscilloscope readings of USB communications, 
generating a top down compilation order for a large VHDL project using Python 
and developing a discrete
logic circuit to multiplex LCD display data. This internship was a period of major growth 
for me. I gained experience with a larger VHDL project, circuit design and layout, power
supply design, Visual Basic, Python and Batch scripting and electronics lab tool usage.}

               {Winter, 2015 - Current}
               {As a teaching assistant I worked directly with instructor 
Matt Shuman to help guide the lab 
portion of the course. On occasion I developed and lead class lectures,
managed lab grading and built lab study material. One of
the larger projects I developed for the course was an FPGA voltmeter which required
implementation of a SPI communications protocol. I have also worked
with Roger Traylor and lectured in his VLSI System Design course, though this
was not an employment arrangement.}

               {2009 - 2012}
{As a Maintenance Supervisor at Riverstone Residential I managed a team 
of three people toward the goal of maintaining 
over 350 homes located within a 10 mile radius. My responsibilities included: ordering
supplies, scheduling of both vendors and employees, maintenance repair requests and 
resident communication. While in this position I developed skills in problem 
solving, communication, time management and leadership.}
