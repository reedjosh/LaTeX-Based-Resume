To whom it may concern,

I am interested in the open Customer Support Engineer position with your company. I have relevant experience and will be graduating June, 2017 from Oregon State with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

I have previously met with Taylor and toured your Corvallis facility. Natural Point produces extremely compelling products, and I'd love to be a part of that.

I've attached my resume, and hope to hear back soon,
