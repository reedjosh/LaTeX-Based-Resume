Experience

    Internship Technical Marketing Engineer
         Mentor Graphics
         June--November, 2016
         -- Created a regression test generation program which converts arbitrary 
                 graphs in node neighbor format to usable input for Mentor's Calibre tools.
         -- Reproduced a customer's bug using the test generation program I wrote
                 without using customer's proprietary data.
         -- Used the test generation program for black box random and corner case testing.

    Digital Design Class & Lab Teaching Assistant
         Oregon State University
         Spring, 2016
         -- Designed volt-meter final lab project framework. This was written in 
                 System Verilog targeting a Lattice FPGA which communicates with an 
                 external ADC via SPI.
         -- Designed and delivered lectures on topics such as Karnaugh maps, registers,
                 and System Verilog to class of more than 80 students.

    Internship Design Engineer
         Garmin AT
         March--September, 2015
         -- Redesigned an aerial receiver's signal demodulation logic achieving a 
                 60% reduction of logic usage while implementing new VHDL 
                 standards to develop cleaner, more abstracted and extensible code.
         -- Wrote a script which troubleshoots and decodes USB communications given 
                 voltage readings in CSV format.
         -- Created a script which generates a top down VHDL project compilation order 
                 given only the project source files.
         -- Built a circuit that multiplexes display signals and provides
                 a controlled current source for the device's backlight.

    Senior Design High Field Pulse Magnet
           -- Worked in a three person team to build a high field pulse magnet.
           -- Pulse magnet successfully generates field pulses in excess of 20 Tesla and 
                crushes quarters to the size of a dime using this massive magnetic field.
           -- Responsible for over-sized voltage display, PCB, and safety power indicator.
    
    VLSI System Design Course Projects
           -- Worked with senior instructor Roger Traylor to integrate an Altera FPGA 
                 into OSU's VLSI System Design coursework.
           -- Created a PLL LED demo project and lectured on PLL implementation, of which 
                 the screen-capture is still linked from the course website today.
           -- Built a sine wave generator utilizing the FPGA's internal rom.
