\opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}

I would love to work at Intel in a design or test role. Intel creates innovative, world
changing products, and I would love to be a part of that. Furthermore, I  believe my interests and
experiences make me an ideal candidate for an entry-level engineering position within
your organization.

While at Garmin I developed HDL skills by redesigning demodulation logic
targeting an Altera Cyclone IV.  For my senior project I successfully 
laid out and implemented an analog circuit on a PCB.
As a teaching assistant I've helped build course demonstrations and 
projects, including an FPGA sine wave generator, a demonstration 
of PLLs using an array of LEDs, and a voltmeter which communicates with an ADC via SPI.
As part of a school project I've simulated and laid out a pipelined multiplier using Spice and
Electric VLSI, and during my time at Mentor Graphics I gained exposure to the EDA industry.

Computer engineering has proven to be an endless source of fascination for me, and
I hope to join Intel on the forefront of this field. I graduate June, 2017 and 
I would love to speak with you about any opportunities to join your team.

\closing{Best Regards,}
