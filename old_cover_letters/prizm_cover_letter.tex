\opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}

Prysm creates innovative, collaboration enhancing products, and I 
would be very excited to be a part of that. I believe I am an ideal
candidate for the FPGA Design and Verification requisition you are
currently hiring for. Unlike most recent \\ graduates, I've had
the opportunity to cut my teeth on some pretty complex FPGA
projects.

While at Garmin I developed skills redesigning demodulation logic
targeting an Altera Cyclone IV. I've played a large role as 
a teaching assistant for the Digital Logic Design course at 
Oregon State University, and I've helped design OSU's VLSI System 
Design coursework, including building an FPGA sine wave generator, 
and a demonstration of PLLs using an array of LEDs. For a school 
project I've simulated and laid out a pipelined multiplier using 
Spice and Electric VLSI, and during my time at Mentor Graphics I 
gained exposure to the EDA industry.

FPGA design has proven to be an endless source of fascination for me--this 
really would be my dream job! I graduate June, 2017 and I would love to 
speak with you about any opportunities to join your team.

\closing{Best Regards,}
